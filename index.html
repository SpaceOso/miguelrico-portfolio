	<p>Yo! Currently working on updating my portfolio. But in the mean time I'll let you know what I've been doing
		to keep my self busy.</p>
	<p>I'm currently working as Front-End Developer and 3D generalist. I take care of any updates to any of our sites,
		and help convert our Unity3D simulations content into HTML + JavaScript interactions. Also work in the Art
		Department, this
		includes creating some of the art for the simulations, video editing and graphic design for marketing and
		print</p>
	<p>During my free time I've been creating a Job Board with React on the Front-End and MongoDB in the back end.
		Connecting
		it all with Express.js and Mongoose.js. You can view the repository for it on my GitHub</p>

			<h2>Professional Profile</h2>
			<p>With my strong technical skills and art background I feel I am a perfect fit for a Junior Front End Web
				Developer. As you can see in my work experience, I am very comfortable with working under tight
				deadlines and in a group environment. Not only do I work well as part of a team, but I also find ways to
				make projects and teams work more quickly and efficiently. Having used many programs in my professional
				life, I embrace learning new languages and software, and do so quickly.</p>
